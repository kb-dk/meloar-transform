As part of the task of making?LOAR available and maintaining it technically, KB will ensure distribution of metadata in order to make data findable (see FAIR principles1, https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).
KB makes LOAR available and maintains it technically. However, this is a noncommercial service with no economic profit. For that reason, KB accepts no responsibility, direct or indirect, in relation to the uploaded research data or the way in which users use the research data.
If doubts arise about the research data?s infringement on others rights or violation of legislation, KB reserves the right to remove research data from?LOAR without notice and without responsibility for any kinds of loss, direct or indirect. This also applies in case of other necessary reasons.
Might it become necessary to remove a file that you have uploaded to LOAR, KB will aim to inform you via the email or alternative address you used when setting up your user profile.
If necessary for technical reasons, KB reserves the right to move the content to another similar repository, or to entirely close the repository. If your research data is removed, your DOI will remain unchanged. If the repository is to be closed, this will be announced on LOAR with at least six months' notice. KB will aim to contact you via the email or alternative address you used when setting up your user profile, such that you will be able to make new arrangements for your data.
KB reserves the right to change the conditions for use at a later stage. You are obliged to keep updated about applicable conditions for?LOAR or any changes to the conditions in force at any given time, as shown in the menu.
Should any conflict arise as a result of the use of LOAR, Danish law shall apply.
